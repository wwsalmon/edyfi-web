        <h1>Why?</h1>

        <p>The internet brought diverse minds to the digital domain. There, the like-minded found each other and formed a
            luxuriant and varietal landscape to inhabit. But the physical landscape remained unchanged. We leverage the beauty
            of technology to create physical spaces for learning and creation. </p>
        <p>At Edyfi, the experience is raw. It is a space for advancement and retreat. Contemplation and movement. Edyfi
            supports you as you build you life and impact. But we also challenges you — what do you believe and why? At Edyfi,
            we cling on to good ideas, not easy ones. We push you to explore and articulate new ideas, but also to make
            deliberate acts to realize them – big thinkers with an ability and desire to execute.</p>
        <p>Edyfi is intentionally dichotomous. Each of our houses are peaceful and teeming with exuberance. These spaces
            encourage and enable the cross fertilization of thought among unlikely collaborators. They create grounds for
            immersive conversation and beautiful friendships. And they provide space for working on loftiest pursuits.</p>
        <p>At Edyfi, we value the talent and brilliance of the people we bring in. Edyfi members play a critical role in
            aligning the organizations values and its members values with their respective directives. They spearhead events and
            Edyfi provides the infrastructure to make them happen. They rethink and implement new forms of house-wide
            governance. We want to build this community with you from the ground up.</p>


        <h2>Inspiration & Vision</h2>

        <p>Edyfi is heavily inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club">Junto</a>), <a
                href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, <a href="https://joininteract.com/">Interact</a>, Reality
            Club, Invisible College, and other community houses (namely <a href="https://archive.house/">The Archive</a>, <a
                href="https://hacklodge.org/">Hack Lodge</a>, <a href="https://school2point0.com/">School 2.0</a>, Embassy
            Network houses, and <a href="https://www.launchhouse.co/">Launch House</a>) and our founders&#39; experience at <a
                href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/">Minerva Schools</a>, the <a href="http://www.mountainschool.org/">Mountain
                School</a>, and <a href="https://tks.world/">The Knowledge Society</a>. We are are also influenced by the
            following thoughts and facts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Educational Institutions have unfairly monopolized people curation and polluted collective growth and the
                exchange of ideas.</li>
            <li>Social isolation and loneliness are on the rise. </li>
            <li>People are happier, more fulfilled, and more inspired in communities.</li>
            <li>Todays problems are vast and complex. They require interdisciplinary stakeholders with domain expertise and a
                bias towards risk.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The kind of change and success we fawn over has all been built by outsiders. They are admired now, but they were once
            operating on the fringes. They&#39;re ideas labeled as ludicrous and obscene. To solve the world&#39;s most pressing
            problems, we need to bring together these people: &quot;the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,
            the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>We believe that by bringing together a diverse group of highly talented people, we can:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Think critically on where we are today and where we need to be</li>
            <li>Collaborate on a roadmap for the next generation</li>
            <li>Build our collective future</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We take Edge&#39;s motto, coined by artist-philosopher James Lee Byars, as heavy inspiration: &quot;To arrive at the
            edge of the world&#39;s knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together,
            and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves.</p>
        <p>We are building micro-campuses and community for these people, organized atop of shared values and a vision for what
            could be. A distributive network of brilliant outsiders, building our collective future.</p>
