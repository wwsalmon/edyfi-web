                <h2>Diversity</h2>
                
                <p>In Edyfi Spring '21, we did a poor job on diversity.</p>
                
                <p>For Summer '21, Edyfi is committing to having at least 40% women and non-binary individuals in each house. BIPOC, immigrants, and LGBTQ candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that
                    everyone benefits from diverse groups of people coming together and that our community should reflect the                    population of the regions and countries its members are from. For more information, see the <a href="/diversity">Diversity,
                        Equity, and Inclusion page.</a></p>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <p>
                <p><b>Who can apply?</b></p>

                <p>Anyone, especially people between 18-23 years old.</p>

                <p><b>Do I need to be technical or a founder to come?</b></p>

                <p>No. We look for people who are deeply curious, passionate, and purpose-driven and who share our
                    values.</p>

                <p><b>Are all people drop outs?</b></p>

                <p>No. Our community has university students, drop-outs, and graduates.</p>

                <p><b>What are the living arrangement?</b></p>

                <p>Book your own room or a shared room. Shared common spaces.</p>

                <p>We provide basics: paper towel, toilet paper, common kitchen items, etc...</p>

                <p><b>When do I have to make a decision, if accepted?</b></p>

                <p>There is not set decision date. So as long as you have been accepted and there is an open room in a house, you may book it. We do not know at what time houses will become fully booked, but we advise that you check the bookings page for more information on availability.</p>

                <p><b>Do I get accepted to specific houses?</b></p>

                <p>If accepted, you are accepted to all Edyfi houses. Under certain circumstances, we may temporarily place houses on hold to ensure diversity and gender balance. Otherwise, you may choose from any of our current house offerings for the cohort you were accepted into.</p>

                <p><b>What does the application process look like?</b></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Submit a written application.</li>
                    <li>Have 1-2 interviews with either current house members or Edyfi's senior leadership (sometimes a 2nd
                        interview is necessary to learn more about an applicant)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>After the second stage, you will either be accepted, waitlisted, or asked to reapply for future cohorts.
                Acceptance rates for the first cohort were just under 10%.</p>

                <p><b>How long does an Edyfi house last for?</b></p>

                <p>Roughly 3 months, depending on location.</p>

                <p><b>What does a typical day at Edyfi look like?</b></p>

                <p>During the day, participants focus on their work or studies. At night and on weekends, there are
                    (non-mandatory) hackathons,
                    outings, cooking, conversations, and more.</p>

                <p><b>What do we care about?</b></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Insatiable Curiosity</li>
                    <li>Altruism</li>
                    <li>Benevolence</li>
